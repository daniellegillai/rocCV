     * Limitations:
     *
     * Input:
     *       Supported TensorLayout(s): [NHWC, HWC]
     *                        Channels: [1, 3, 4]
     *       Supported DataType(s):     [U8, U16, S16, S32, F32]
     *
     * Output:
     *       Supported TensorLayout(s): [NHWC, HWC]
     *                        Channels: [1, 3, 4]
     *       Supported DataType(s):     [U8, U16, S16, S32, F32]
     *
     * Parameter requirements:
     *       sigmaX: Must be positive (> 0).
     *       sigmaY: If non-positive (<= 0) will set to sigmaX.
     *       kernelWidth: Must be odd and positive, or non-positive (<= 0), in which case it is inferred from sigmaX.
     *                    Inferred kernel size is calculated as: round(sigmaX × (U8 ? 6 : 8) + 1) | 1
     *                    Must not exceed m_maxKernelWidth after inference.
     *       kernelHeight: Must be odd and positive, or non-positive (<= 0) in which case it is inferred from sigmaY.
     *                     Inferred kernel size is calculated as: round(sigmaY × (U8 ? 6 : 8) + 1) | 1
     *                     Must not exceed m_maxKernelHeight after inference.
     *
     * Input/Output dependency:
     *
     *       Property      |  Input == Output
     *      -------------- | -------------
     *       TensorLayout  | Yes
     *       DataType      | Yes
     *       Channels      | Yes
     *       Width         | Yes
     *       Height        | Yes
     *       Batch         | Yes
     *
     * @param[in] stream The HIP stream to run this operation on.
     * @param[in] input Input tensor.
     * @param[out] output Output tensor.
     * @param[in] kernelWidth Gaussian kernel width.
     * @param[in] kernelHeight Gaussian kernel height.
     * @param[in] sigmaX Gaussian kernel standard deviation in X direction.
     * @param[in] sigmaY Gaussian kernel standard deviation in Y direction.
     * @param[in] borderMode A border type to identify the pixel extrapolation
     * method (e.g. BORDER_TYPE_CONSTANT or BORDER_TYPE_REPLICATE).
     * @param[in] device The device which this operation should run on. (Default: eDeviceType::GPU)
